              My Mommy and Daddy said that I had to be nice as long as people
              are nice to me. But then there was this boy in my class I thought
              looked funny and I wanted to say that to him. So I hired a secret
              agent of They to get him to be mean to me. He said that I am fat.
              Then I told him his face looked like a cheese grate. It didn't
              feel good to get called fat but I can be mean to him all I want!

              I've made my far share of enemies back in the day. I know I should

              start apologizing to him but he started yellin' at me good. He

              he's worked for They all along! Now I never want to apologize to

              All the homework I get in school is exhausting. Most the time I
              don't even do it. I play with my friends instead. None of this

              homework. This got me thinking. If I hired an agent of They to
              destroy my homework everyday then I'd be fine. So I did. They
              would push me over in the parking lot and steal my homework! When
              the teacher asked where my homework was, I said, "They stole it."
